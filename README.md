# Blaze-Multiplayer-Shooter-FPS-TPS-

This repository contains the backend code for my multiplayer shooter game. Iâ€™ve intentionally included some errors to prevent misuse, but these can be easily fixed. This code is designed to help developers understand the functionality and mechanics of the project. Happy coding and learning!
